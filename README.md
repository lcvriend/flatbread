# Flatbread

## Name
Initially I planned for this library to be called pita -- short for pivot tables. But as that name was already taken on pypi.org the choice fell on flatbread.

## About
Flatbread is a library built upon pandas and matplotlib for displaying and presenting data. Under construction.
